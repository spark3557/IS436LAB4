<h1>Department of Information Systems</h1>
<h3>Bachelor’s Degree Programs</h3>
<div class="bullets">
<ul>
		<li> <span class="special"> Bachelor of Science in Information System:</span> The BS program prepares students for all potential career positions in the IS field. These include: Systems Analysis and Design, Computer Networking and Health Care Informatics.
		</li>
		<li><span class="special"> Bachelor of Arts in Business Technology Administration:</span> The BA program is designed for students who want a basic education in the use of IT for various business purposes. The BA degree is less technical in nature than the BS program and the focus of the courses is on using IT of different types to solve problems that arise in a business setting.
		</li>
		<li><span class="special">Combined Bachelor of Arts in Business Technology Administration/Human-Centered Computing Master of Science:</span> The BTA BA/HCC MS degree program allows the student to complete both degrees with usually one more year of study than is typically required for the BTA BA degree alone, since three of the courses in the Master’s core are taken while completing the undergraduate degree but are applied to both degrees.
		</li>
		</ul>
